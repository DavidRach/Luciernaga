Description: Having good quality unmixing controls is critical to accurate unmixing of full-stained samples in Spectral Flow Cytometry, but few tools exist to check whether this is the case. In this package we provide tools for quality control checks, signature interrogation and data visualization to allow individuals responsible for the pre-processing to make informed decisions. Tools are implemented for individual .fcs files at a single timepoint or across an experimental run
