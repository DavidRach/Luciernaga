Description:
  High quality unmixing controls are critical in Spectral Flow Cytometry (SFC)
  for the accurate unmixing of full-stained samples. Despite this importance,
  few tools are available for their quality control. Luciernaga provides series
  of functions to allow individual researchers to implement quality control and
  interrogate effects that different fluorescent signatures have on their
  unmixing to make informed decisions while reducing the guess-work.
  Tools are implemented for individual .fcs files at a single timepoint
  or across an experimental run.
