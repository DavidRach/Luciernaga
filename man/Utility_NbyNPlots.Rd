\arguments{
\item{x}{A GatingSet object (ex. gs or gs[[1]])}

\item{sample.name}{Keyword for which samples names are stored (ex. "GUID")}

\item{removestrings}{A string of characters to remove from name (ex. c("DR_ILT_2023_", "Cord"))}

\item{experiment}{Provide directly an experiment name (ex. "Jan2024")}

\item{experiment.name}{Keyword for which experiment name is stored (ex. "GROUPNAME")}

\item{condition}{Provide a condition name}

\item{condition.name}{The keyword in the .fcs file storing the condition.name}

\item{marginsubset}{The Gating Hierarchy level from which values will be used to estimate the plot margins (ex. "nonDebris")}

\item{gatesubset}{The Gating Hierarchy level of the cells that you want to see plotted (ex. "lymph")}

\item{ycolumn}{The ycolumn that you want to see everything plotted by (ex. "APC-A") or ALL to see all comparisons}

\item{bins}{Bins for which the plotted cells will be divided into providing granularity}

\item{clearance}{The additional ratio added to the margins to avoid clipping main population but exclude outliers.}

\item{gatelines}{Whether to add estimated gate cutoff lines}

\item{reference}{Reference for the gate cutoff lines}

\item{outpath}{Location for which to store the generated .pdf}

\item{pdf}{Prints default NxN plot, TRUE or FALSE.}
