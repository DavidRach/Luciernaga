is stored (ex. "TUBENAME")}

\item{condition}{Provide directly experiment name (ex. "JAN2024")}

\item{condition.name}{Keyword variable which experiment information
is stored (ex. "TUBENAME")}

\item{AFOverlap}{A data.frame or a filepath to the CSV containing the Autofluorescence
overlap of individual fluorophores for exclusion}

\item{stats}{Whether to take "mean" or "median"}
