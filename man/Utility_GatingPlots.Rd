\item{export}{Whether to return as a .pdf file or as individual patchwork ggplot objects.}

\item{experiment.name}{The .fcs keyword that contains the name of the experiment}

\item{experiment}{Directly provide the name of the experiment (alternative to experiment.name)}

\item{condition.name}{The .fcs keyword that contains the name of the condition.}

\item{condition}{Directly provide the name of the condition (alternative to condition.name)}

\item{bins}{Argument to geom_hex for number of bins to visualize the plotted data density.}

\item{clearance}{A buffer area around the plot edge}
